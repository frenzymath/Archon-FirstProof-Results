/-! ### Normalized edge setup infrastructure

**Normalized edge setup (Step 1)**: For any graph G on V, there
exist PSD matrices `A : V -> Fin r -> Matrix V V R` (one per
(vertex, color) pair), with the property that:
(a) Each `A v g` is PSD
(b) For each vertex v, some color g has `A v g <= (e/n)*I`
(c) If M is a sum of selected `A v g`'s satisfying `M < u*I`
    with `u < e`, then each color class is e-light

The following sub-lemmas establish the mathematical
infrastructure needed. -/

/-- Sub-lemma: If L^{1/2} is a Hermitian matrix with L^{1/2} * L^{1/2} = L (on the relevant
    subspace), and M ≼ u*I, then L^{1/2} * M * L^{1/2} ≼ u * L.
    This is the key pullback that converts barrier domination into Laplacian domination. -/

/-- Sub-lemma: ε-lightness from Loewner bound on normalized Laplacian.
    If for some PSD Hermitian Lhalf with Lhalf^2 = L (the graph Laplacian),
    we have ∑_{e in E(S,S)} A_e ≼ ε * I where A_e = Lhalf_inv * L_e * Lhalf_inv,
    then S is ε-light.
    More precisely: if (ε * L - inducedLaplacian G S) is PSD when the inducedLaplacian
    is dominated by ε * graphLaplacian, then S is ε-light. The key step is showing
    that the Loewner bound on normalized edge contributions implies the Loewner bound
    on the original Laplacians.
    For this sub-lemma, we take the simple route: if we can show that
    ε * graphLaplacian G - inducedLaplacian G S is PSD, then S is ε-light by definition. -/
